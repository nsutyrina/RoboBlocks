# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

## RoboBlocks Team Policies
### Technology Use
All team members must remain fully engaged during meetings. No distracted use of technology (e.g., phones must be put away) is permitted during team meetings unless required for the discussion.
### Decision Making
Decisions will be made using a consensus-based approach whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will determine the outcome. If the vote is split in half and consensus cannot be reached, we communicate with outside sources for advice (other classmates, TA’s, instructors, etc.)
### Attendance
Team members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings. Legitimate reasons for missing a meeting include illness, emergencies, or academic conflicts. Members who miss a meeting must reach out to the SCRUM master to catch up with the group.
### Assignments
Tasks will be assigned based on member strengths, interests, and workload balance. Members who fail to complete or poorly complete assignments will be required to meet with the team to determine corrective action, which may include redistribution of tasks or additional responsibilities.
### Participation
All members are expected to contribute equally and communicate openly. Team discussions and decisions will be documented and shared to ensure transparency. Efforts will be made to recognize and utilize each member’s strengths and interests in the project.
### Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums
Meeting times and locations will be decided collaboratively to ensure maximum participation. Virtual meetings may be scheduled when necessary.
### Promptness
Members are expected to arrive on time for meetings. Repeated tardiness will require a discussion with the team to address the issue.
### Conversational Courtesies
The team will promote active listening, equitable participation, and respectful dialogue. Tangents should be minimized to ensure meetings remain productive.
### Enforcement and Feedback
Team members are responsible for holding each other accountable. Feedback will be provided constructively and respectfully, with individuals encouraged to express their preferences for receiving feedback.
### Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include acting as a representative of the group outside the group work.
### Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
1. Correction

Consequence: A verbal warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
