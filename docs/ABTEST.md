# A/B Test Name: Introduction Message
User Story Number: US6
As a user, I want to feel welcomed and engaged by the initial message so that I’m more likely to respond and continue the conversation.

Metrics:
Response rate to the initial message
Time to first response
Engagement rate (continued conversation beyond initial reply)

Hypothesis:
If we add a polite social cue like "Nice to meet you!" to the initial message, users will feel more welcomed and be more likely to respond, increasing the response rate.

Experiment:
We ran an A/B test comparing two different greeting messages in a conversational interface.

Variations:
Variation A (Control): "Hi! My name is Rob! What's your name?"
Variation B (Test): "Hi! My name is Rob! Nice to meet you! What's your name?"

# A/B Test Name: Sign In Button Color – Red vs. Green

**User Story Number:** US1 – User Account Creation

**Metrics:**  
- Engagement: Number of clicks on the Sign In button  
- Task Success: Number of successful sign-ins  

**Hypothesis:**  
If the Sign In button is changed from red to green, users will be more likely to click it and complete sign-in because green is commonly associated with positive actions like "go".

**Experiment:**  
Split users into two groups:  
- **Group A:** Sign In button remains red (#FF4C4C)  
- **Group B:** Sign In button is changed to green (#34A853)

**Variations:**  
- **Variation A:** Red Sign In button (current version)  
- **Variation B:** Green Sign In button (test version)
